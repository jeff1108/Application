I have recently completed my degree and would like to apply the program, since I strongly appreciate the idea of democratisation of learning and technology. Continuous self-improvement is crucial in the ever-changing world, where I think “Founders and Coders” provide a good platform that enable me to inspire and contribute my ideas. Thus, the initialisation to contribute and drive changes to the tech community.

<h1 class="injected-text" align="center">What motivates me?</h1>
<div class="box brown-box">
  <h3 class="box white-box black-text">As quoted by Steve Jobs, “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower”. The quote inspired me to fully challenge myself and be truly exposed to the uprising technologies. My long term goal is to fulfil the requirements for a satisfaction app developer, where the apps innovation could transform human lives and hence contributing to the society.  
I think coding become very important nowadays, and I love technology help us to turn our ideas and imaginations into practice/reality.

  <h3 class="box white-box black-text">As I studied Banking and Finance in my undergraduate degree, where I self-studied the Code Academy and the free code camp system. I believe in order to pursue further, it would be fundamental to participate in this program, where I will be able to develop my technical skills further. I believe working as a team, that I can equip myself further and acquire the skills from others. 
<br>In conclude, I hope that with my strong determination and passion. I can participate in the scheme where I could pursue further and contribute to the wider community. </br>
